# JSON Calendar

JSON Calendar is a modern, open-source format for storing and sharing calendar data.

## Motivation

`.jsoncalendar` is a modernization and reduction of the `.icalendar` format. iCalendars
while useful, are verbose and complex. `.jsoncalendar` is a more focused format that
remove concepts like `VTODO` or `VJOURNAL` and instead focuses on the `VEVENT` object.

Since `.jsoncalendar` is a JSON format, it is easier to parse and more readable than
`.icalendar`, making it more accessible for developers and programming languages.

## Specification

The current specification is available [here](/spec/1.0)
