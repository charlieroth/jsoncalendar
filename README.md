# An open file format for modern calendar software

The JSON Calendar format was created to rethink what is essential to calendar
applications in the year 2025 and to fully embrace JSON as the data structure.

JSON Calendar is inspired by [JSON Canvas](jsoncanvas.org). The format is
designed to be easy to parse and give users ownership of their data. JSON Calendar
files use the `.jsoncalendar` extension.

JSON Calendar can be implemented freely as import, export, and storage format
for any app or tool. This site and all resources associated with JSON Calendar
are open source under the MIT License.
