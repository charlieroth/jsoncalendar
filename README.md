# An open file format for modern calendar software

The JSON Calendar format was created to rethink what is essential to calendar
applications in the year 2025 and to fully embrace JSON as the data structure.

The format is designed to be easy to parse and give users ownership of their
data. JSON Calendar files use the `.jsoncalendar` extension.

JSON Calendar is being developed in conjunction with [localndr](https://github.com/charlieroth/localndr).
JSON Calendar can be implemented freely as import, export, and storage format
for any app or tool. This site and all resources associated with JSON Calendar
are open source under the MIT License.
