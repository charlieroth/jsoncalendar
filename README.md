# An open file format for calendar data.

Calendars are a way to view and organize our lives. Calendars encourage accountability of the past, present and future.

The JSON Calendar format was created to provide longevity, readbaility and interopability for calendar applications. The format
is designed to be easy to parse and give users [ownership of their data](https://stephango.com/file-over-app). JSON Calendar files use the `.jsoncalendar` extension.

JSON Calendar can be implemented freely as an import, export, and storage format for any app or tool.
This site, and all resources associated with JSON Calendar are [open source](https://github.com/charlieroth/jsoncalendar) under the MIT license.
