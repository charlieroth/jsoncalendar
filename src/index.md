# An open file format for calendar data.

Calendars are more than timekeepersâ€”they shape our past, present, and future. They underpin both individual organization and the coordination of global activities. JSON Calendar builds on iCalendar and jCal to offer a modern, accessible, and interoperable standard for seamlessly accessing, sharing, and storing calendar data, reaffirming the critical role calendars play in accountability, collaboration, and planning.

JSON Calendar was created to provide longevity, readbaility and interopability for calendar software. The format
is designed to be easy to parse and give users [ownership of their data](https://stephango.com/file-over-app). JSON Calendar files use the `.jsoncalendar` extension.

JSON Calendar uses [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/) to define the structure of the calendar data.

JSON Calendar can be implemented freely as an import, export, and storage format for any [app or tool](/apps).
This site, and all resources associated with JSON Calendar are [open source](https://github.com/charlieroth/jsoncalendar) under the MIT license.
